{"name":"Projects","tagline":"by A. P. Sillers","body":"**Hi there!** I'm Andrew Sillers, a software developer who loves working with font-end and back-end Web technologies, especially JavaScript.\r\n* I'm a regular participant in Stack Overflow's `javascript` tag section, where I love answering tough questions about prototypal inheritance, asynchronous code, and cross-origin issues. Check out [my Stack Overflow profile](https://stackoverflow.com/users/710446/apsillers), if you like.\r\n* My recreational programming goes up on GitHub, so have a look at [my projects on GitHub](https://github.com/apsillers).\r\nHere's a few of my favorite personal projects, all written in JavaScript.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### **[HTML5 Netrek Client](https://github.com/apsillers/html5-netrek)**\r\n**[[playable demo](https://netrek-apsillers.rhcloud.com/)]**\r\n\r\n[HTML5 Netrek Client](https://github.com/apsillers/html5-netrek) is a browser-based client for the old-school space battle game [Netrek](http://www.netrek.org). Choose one of five different ship classes, and conquer the galaxy with superior dogfighting, strategy, and teamwork. Using HTML5 WebSockets, you can engage in real-time multiplayer combat, playing right alongside players using the full desktop client!\r\n\r\n**Built with:** Node.js, [CAKE.js](https://code.google.com/p/cakejs/) (canvas), [Socket.IO](http://socket.io) (networking)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### **[Taggem](https://github.com/apsillers/Taggem)**\r\n**[[playable demo](https://taggem-apsillers.rhcloud.com/)]**\r\n\r\n[Taggem](https://github.com/apsillers/Taggem) is an experimental multiplayer real-time [roguelike](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roguelike) you can play in your Web browser. The modular architecture of the code allows developers to quickly add new items and monsters to the game. In this simple demo implementation, you can battle nymphs, hide behind boulders, blast enemies with freezing wands, and use portal guns to teleport yourself around the dungeon.\r\n\r\n**Built with:** Node.js, [ROT.js](ondras.github.io/rot.js) (canvas/rougelike utilities), [Socket.IO](http://socket.io) (networking)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### **[Lords of the Fey](https://github.com/apsillers/lords-of-the-fey)**\r\n\r\n[Lords of the Fey](https://github.com/apsillers/lords-of-the-fey) is a nascent re-implementation of [Battle for Wesnoth](http://www.wesnoth.org) for the Web using HTML5 technologies like WebSockets and the Canvas API. The user interface is only partially complete, but most basic gameplay features (movement/pathing, unit creation, combat, villages) are implemented.\r\n\r\n**Built with:** Node.js, [EaselJS](http://www.createjs.com/#!/EaselJS) (canvas), [Socket.IO](http://socket.io) (networking), [Express](http://expressjs.com) (Web server and user auth), [MongoDB](http://www.mongodb.org) (storage)\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n### **[Stacklife](https://github.com/apsillers/stacklife)**\r\n**[[demo](http://stackoverflow.com/users/710446/apsillers)]**\r\n\r\n[Stacklife](https://github.com/apsillers/stacklife) is a combination of server-side logic and simple static content that creates an interactive implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life) that you can display virtually anywhere on the Web -- even in a Stack Overflow profile.\r\n\r\n**Built with:** Node.js, [Express](http://expressjs.com) (Web server)","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
